## Introduction to C++
### Programming Language
- A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers.
- It is a set of instructions written in any specific language (C, C++, Java, Python) to perform a specific task. 
### What is C++?
- C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist **Bjarne Strousturp**
- Why do we need it?
	- Object Oriented Programming
	- Control over system resources and memory
	- Performance: Efficiency and speed
- Uses of C++
	- System/Software development
	- Game Development
	- Real time systems
### Compilation Process
- A code undergoes compilation process to get converted into machine-understandable format so that it can be executed.
- **Overview of Compilation:** Turning source code into executable code.
- **Steps in the Compilation Process:** 
	- Preprocessing
	- Compilation
	- Assembly
	- Linking
### High and Low Level Languages
- **High Level Language:** High Level Languages are used for writing programs & software that can be understood by humans and computers. They are easier to understand for humans because they use a lot of symbols letter phrases to represent logic and instructions in a program.
- **Low Level Language:** Low Level Languages are closer to hardware as compared to High Level Languages instead of software. They provide little or no abstraction from the machine instructions and that's why they allow programmers to manipulate hardware elements like register, memory, etc. They are often used for designing systems, such as developing operating systems, device drivers and embedded systems.

## Introduction to C++
### Programming Language
- A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers.
- It is a set of instructions written in any specific language (C, C++, Java, Python) to perform a specific task. 
### What is C++?
- C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist **Bjarne Strousturp**
- Why do we need it?
	- Object Oriented Programming
	- Control over system resources and memory
	- Performance: Efficiency and speed
- Uses of C++
	- System/Software development
	- Game Development
	- Real time systems
### Compilation Process
- A code undergoes compilation process to get converted into machine-understandable format so that it can be executed.
- **Overview of Compilation:** Turning source code into executable code.
- **Steps in the Compilation Process:** 
	- Preprocessing
	- Compilation
	- Assembly
	- Linking
